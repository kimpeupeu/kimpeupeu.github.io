Quant is a term that is commonly used in the field of finance and refers to quantitative finance or quantitative analysis. It refers to a systematic and mathematical approach to making investment decisions, often using statistical models and computer algorithms to analyze financial data and make predictions about future market trends and behavior.

Quantitative finance involves the use of mathematical models and statistical techniques to evaluate financial instruments and portfolios, predict market behavior, and make investment decisions. This approach can help reduce the subjectivity and emotional biases that can impact investment decisions and help investors make more informed and data-driven decisions.

Quantitative analysis can be applied to a wide range of financial instruments and markets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and derivatives. It is widely used in investment banking, hedge funds, asset management, and other financial institutions.
